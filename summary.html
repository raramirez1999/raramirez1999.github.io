								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<hr />
								<p>Born and raised in Southern California to two loving parents, I developed an early passion for math, science, and technology. From a young age, I was drawn to problem-solving 
									and found immense joy in unraveling puzzles. As I grew older, I delved into the world of technology, building my first computer in middle school and honing my coding skills 
									with Raspberry Pi projects.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    Driven by a deep thirst for knowledge and academic excellence, I earned a full scholarship to California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). Throughout my college journey, 
									I actively engaged in campus life, participating in various volunteer opportunities, such as "Family Math Night," where I had the privilege to teach over 150 K-8th grade students 
									and their parents problem-solving skills in math and science. 
								</p>
								<p>
									As a first-generation college graduate, I take immense pride in being the trailblazer in my family. My success serves as an inspiration to my younger siblings and other family 
									members, motivating them to pursue their dreams with the right mindset, strong values, and quality education.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    With an unwavering determination, I am steadfast in my pursuit of a fulfilling career in data science, data analytics, or various engineering fields. My drive to make a positive 
									impact through innovation and problem-solving fuels my passion for continuous learning and professional growth. I am committed to leveraging my expertise in mathematics, 
									computer science, and data science to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of technology and analytics.

								<h2>Education</h2>
								<hr />
								<p>California State University, San Bernardino<br>August 2018 - May 2023<br>Bachelors degree, Mathematics </p>
								<p> During my academic journey, I pursued a diverse range of math and computer science courses that laid a strong foundation for my career in data science and analytics. My coursework 
									encompassed advanced topics in Statistics, Combinatorics, Discrete Math, Number Theory, and Real Analysis, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of mathematical principles.
								</p>
								<p>Additionally, I delved into the world of computer science with courses such as Python Programming, Python Data Structures, C++ Data Structures, and Machine Organization. Through these 
									courses, I honed my programming skills and acquired proficiency in languages like SQL, Python, and C++. Moreover, I gained valuable experience working with SQL databases such as MySQL, 
									IBM DB2, and SQLite, enabling me to handle and manipulate large datasets effectively.
